# [Elite Community](https://discord.elitecommunity.it)

Elite SCP, better known with the new name in *Elite Community*, was created on April 27, 2019, its foundation is based on an idea of DBD, first created *DBD Italia*, and then moved to SCP: SL.

The server plugins are mostly created by the two Founders (`iopietro` and `Terminator97`) and by the CEO (and Co-Founder) `Bay`, who joined the management on June 21, 2020.

Their development is very complex, they are developed in C#, with two different APIs, that of [Northwood](https://github.com/northwood-studios/NwPluginAPI) and that of [EXILED](https://github.com/EXILED-Team/EXILED), in greater use of the second.
The first option is used in major by Bay.

Our top rated plugins, by players, are [SCP-6666] (aka SCP-DON_FRANCO), [SCP-1162], [XPPro] and [SCPUtils](https://github.com/Terminator-97/SCPUtils); only plugin among these to be public.

### - With love, Bay (Event Director, HR Director, Technical Support Supervisor, CO-FOUNDER and CEO)
